# DanKeJson



JSON (J ava S cript O bject N otation) is a simple, yet powerful notation to specify data. It defines simple scalar types such as boolean, number (integers and reals) and string, and a couple of data structures: arrays (lists) and objects (dictionaries). For more information on the JSON format, visit [JSON.org](http://www.json.org/).
