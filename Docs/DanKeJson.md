# DanKeJson

JSON (J ava S cript O bject N otation) is a simple, yet powerful notation to specify data. It defines simple scalar types such as boolean, number (integers and reals) and string, and a couple of data structures: arrays (lists) and objects (dictionaries). For more information on the JSON format, visit [JSON.org](http://www.json.org/).

JSON5 (JSON for Humans) is an extension to the popular JSON file format that aims to be easier to **write and maintain \*by hand\* (e.g. for config files)**. It is *not intended* to be used for machine-to-machine communication. For more information on the JSON format, visit [JSON5.org](http://www.json5.org/).

DanKeJson is a simple Json library for the .Net.
